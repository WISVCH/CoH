On the 21st of May we are organising the annual Master-Alumni Career Speeddates event. This event is a great chance for current master students to chat with alumni like you and learn about different career paths in Mathematics and Computer Science. It's not just about your current job â€“ your journey and experiences can really help our students who are just starting their careers. The format of the event will involve brief one-on-one sessions between master students and alumni.

You can sign up via the following link: https://forms.gle/MmoTa4RXLzBA4f8V7. When there are any updates or changes to the event, we will update you via the email you have signed up with.

- Date: Tuesday 21st of May
- Time: Evening (exact time will be communicated later)
- Location: /Pub (bar below the faculty EEMCS (Dutch: EWI), Mekelweg 4 in Delft)
